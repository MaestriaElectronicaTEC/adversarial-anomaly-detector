This project has been able to corroborate that the variational autoencoder architectures do not have the needed performance to achieve a decent anomaly detection due to its blur issues. On the other side the AnoGAN has more promising results with better reconstruction images.

A modification to the AnoGAN architecture was tried, allowing it to improve considerably the reconstruction time.

As future work, the objective must be to improve the generator of the GAN. One possible strategy is in the implementation of a disentangling representation of the generator latent space \cite{Higgins2016}. Another possible approach is the use of a regularized in the latent space of the generator, in a similar way as proposed in \cite{Karras2018}.

Finally, a segmentation process should be implemented in order to mark the possible anomalous areas.
